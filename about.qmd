Yo, Rushi here! I recently graduated from IIT Jodhpur. Most of my time is spent researching and developing artificial learning algorithms inspired by the incredible human brain. I like to learn new things by helping others learn about them. I love explaining complex ideas in a simple manner and simple concepts with a deeper perspective! 

Also, e/acc ftw! Letâ€™s make sure AGI takes over the world before politics and war do!
