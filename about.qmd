Yo, Rushi here! I am an undergrad at IIT Jodhpur doing research on topics related to “artificial learning”. I like to learn new things by helping others learn about them. I love explaining complex things in a simple manner and simple things with a complex perspective! 

Also, e/acc ftw! Let’s ensure AGI takes over the world before politics and war do!
